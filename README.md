# Wordle in IDLE
This is a about 220 line project including white space and comments.  It took me about three and half weeks to write this and I'm pretty proud as I'm no expert on python yet, although hopefully in the future I am.  It consists of 5 main functions, broken up and used in a final main game management function that incorporates elements from all of the others.

# Getting Started
Simply download both the wordle.py file, as well as the words.dat file.  Make sure they are both in the same directory, like a file on your desktop or both in downloads.

# Prerequisites
I used Python 3.10.4 for this project, I've noticed sometimes when I write things at my computer lab at school that the older Anaconda models and python to an extension give weird errors from 3.8 to 3.9.  Just to be safe use 3.10.4.

# Give examples 
To run the game, make sure you have the words.dat file under the same directory as wordle.py.  Open IDLE in the shell and then run the module, it will automatically start the game.

# Running the tests
If you go into the code you can find line 123 and uncomment it to enable cheat mode to see what the word is. The symbols +, ?, ., all are specific commands that start a new game, show turn history for a given game, and quit the game respectively.

If you want to test individual functions, take the first 4 out into an empty .py file and call them from the shell.

# Closing statement
Thank you to all who took the time to read this and look into my work. I'd like this to be the first chapter of a many paged book in my programming and computer science story.
